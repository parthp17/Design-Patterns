A prototype is a template of any object before the actual object is constructed. In java also, it holds the same meaning.
Prototype design pattern is used in scenarios where application needs to create a number of instances of a class, which has almost same state or differs very little.
In this design pattern, an instance of actual object (i.e. prototype) is created on starting, and thereafter whenever a new instance is required, this prototype is cloned to have another instance.
The main advantage of this pattern is to have minimal instance creation process which is much costly than cloning process.

Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client.
The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, something that may include costly operations.
The existing object acts as a prototype and contains the state of the object.
The newly copied object may change same properties only if required.
This approach saves costly resources and time, especially when the object creation is a heavy process.
