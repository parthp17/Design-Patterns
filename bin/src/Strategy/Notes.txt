Strategy Design pattern - defines a family of algorithm, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Startegy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

	Policy Pattern
	Code for the interface and not for the implementation.
	Inject the reference to the interface inside the class to provide a behaviour.
	At runtime provide the concrete implementation of the interface into the constructor.
	Depending on the injected implementation, different objects will execute different algorithm
	Uses composition(HAS-A) over inheritance, HAS-A provides lot more flexibility
