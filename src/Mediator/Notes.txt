Mediator enables decoupling of objects by introducing a layer in between so that the interaction between objects happen via the layer.
If the objects interact with each other directly, the system components are tightly-coupled with each other that makes higher maintainability cost and not hard to extend.
Mediator pattern focuses on providing a mediator between objects for communication and help in implementing lose-coupling between objects.
