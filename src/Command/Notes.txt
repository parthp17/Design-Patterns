The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern and is part of the GoF‘s formal list of design patterns.
Simply put, the pattern intends to encapsulate in an object all the data required for performing a given action (command), including what method to call, the method’s arguments, and the object to which the method belongs.

This model allows us to decouple objects that produce the commands from their consumers, so that’s why the pattern is commonly known as the producer-consumer pattern.

In a classic implementation, the command pattern requires implementing four components: the Command, the Receiver, the Invoker, and the Client.
invoker also stores and queues commands, aside from executing them. This is useful for implementing some additional features, such as macro recording or undo and redo functionality.
